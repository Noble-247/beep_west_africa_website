    abstract:
      "The Macruz Index is a simple electrocardiographic methodology indicated in the evaluation of possible left atrial remodeling in human medicine. In dogs, the main cause of left atrial remodeling is mitral valve myxomatous degeneration, a degenerative valvulopathy with high occurrence in the routine of the veterinary clinic. Thus, the objective was to determine the values of the Macruz Index and correlate them with the echocardiographic variable left atrium/aorta ratio in dogs with valvulopathy. For this, 11 healthy dogs, male and female, aged between 2 and 8 years, weighing up to 10 kg were selected; together with 60 dogs with mitral valve myxomatous degeneration, small breed and ages 7 to 17 years, which were subdivided into groups according to the class of congestive heart failure - B1 (n=20), B2 (n=20) and C (n=20). All dogs in the present study underwent clinical cardiological, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evaluation in order to obtain the values of the Macruz Index and the left atrium/aorta ratio. The results showed a significant difference (p<0.05) between the values of the Macruz Index of healthy dogs compared to the groups of dogs with the studied valvular disease (class B2 and C1). However, its correlation with the values of the left atrium/aorta ratio obtained in dogs with mitral valve myxomatous degeneration according to the congestive heart failure classes was low, positive and not statistically significant. Thus, we can conclude that the Macruz Index suggests left atrial remodeling in dogs with mitral valve myxomatous degeneration compared to healthy dogs. However, it does not correlate or evidence progressive left atrial remodeling between classes of congestive heart failure.",

      "Bovine mastitis is a disease with a high economic impact on dairy farms and it has been described that different species of Candida can cause it. The objectives of this study were to evidence the production of biofilm by strains of Candida Kefyr, to carry out a comparative evaluation of its production by tube and plate techniques, to determine its interaction with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus dysgalactiae isolated from bovine mastitis and know the drug susceptibility of each of them. The identification of C. kefyr was carried out by fermentation and assimilation of carbohydrates, the confirmation of the identification and minimum inhibitory concentration to antimycotics was carried out with Vitek 2 Systems. Plate and tube biofilm formation assays were performed in triplicate. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test were performed, as well as Spearman's correlation to the data obtained. In plate tests, biofilm formation was demonstrated in seven C. kefyr isolates, as well as synergy in combinations with E. coli and S. dysgalactiae. However, the inoculum containing the three microorganisms behaved similarly to that containing only C. kefyr and S. dysgalactiae. It was possible to demonstrate a correlation between biofilm formation tests in tube and plate. This is the first report in Mexico of C. kefyr, as well as the production of biofilm in bovine clinical mastitis.",

      "Ticks are the most important ectoparasites that are responsible for severe economic losses in livestock industry. The use of chemical acaricides is the most common method used to control ticks in livestock. This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of Aspergillus oryzae as an alternative biological agent in controlling ticks to enhance livestock productivity. The efficacy of A. oryzae at different concentrations was evaluated against larvae and adults of the hard tick genera Rhipicephalus, Boophilus, and Amblyomma using an immersion test under laboratory conditions. Field trials were conducted in two purposively selected cattle herds in Monduli district, northern Tanzania. A. oryzae at a concentration of 1 × 106 conidial/ml was sprayed on all cattle tick-infested areas. The results demonstrated a concentration-related increase in mortality for both larvae and adult female engorged ticks. The mean mortality of larvae and female engorged ticks was statistically significant at p ? 0.05 and p ? 0.001, respectively. Egg production was found to decrease with increased A. oryzae concentration. Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference in egg production index and oviposition reduction (p = 0.009) while there was no significant difference in egg hatching and product effectiveness at p = 0.089 and p = 0.004, respectively between the tested ticks’ genera. Under field conditions, the bio-acaricide demonstrated a statistically significant tick reduction in all the treated cattle. This study concludes that A. oryzae has good acaricidal activity against ticks and hence, is one of the potential tick control methods for sustainable tick control schemes.",

    abstract:
      "Gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction in rabbits is common due to the peculiarities of their gastrointestinal tract.  This condition usually has an acute progression before the rabbit succumbs or recovers. Due to the acute nature of gastrointestinal obstruction in rabbits, early detection is important. Contrast radiography and ultrasonography are two non-invasive imaging procedures that can be used to detect underlying disease conditions and lesions. This study is designed to assess how these imaging procedures identify GI disturbance and obstruction and can be an aid to early medical intervention. Five male rabbits reared in single battery cages had their diet altered: they were given digestible fiber, starch and water per day to simulate GI obstruction. They were given a barium meal after being sedated and their GI tracts were imaged radiographically and ultrasonographically. The rabbits presented radiographic evidence of gastric dilatation, pooling of the barium meal in the stomach and distention of the small and large intestines with gas. Ultrasonographic features of gas distended stomachs and hyperechoic outlining of the small intestinal mucosa peculiar to GI disturbance were observed. Both imaging techniques were useful in diagnosing GI obstruction and will be useful in early diagnosis and consequent therapy. It can reduce mortality in rabbits. However, contrast radiography is possibly an easier tool to use.",

      "Brucellosis is endemic in pastoral settings of Tanzania with significant socio-economic implications. However, comprehensive studies to establish its impacts had not been elucidated. A longitudinal study was conducted in order to elucidate the dynamics and its impact on production and reproduction. Initially, 464 animals were enrolled with baseline seroprevalence in each herd. Animals were bled every three months to determine the incidence rate, impacts and trends in sero-status. In addition, individual animal reproductive information was collected. Milk yield was measured indirectly by estimating the calves’ growth rate. Data were analysed using Epi Info 7.0 software where descriptive analyses were used to establish proportions, associations and relationships. Wilcoxon test was used to establish the growth rate differences. Forty-seven new c-ELISA seropositive animals were identified over the period of three months representing an incidence rate of 0.811 cases per animal-year at risk. Households with a high seroprevalence during baseline screening were observed to have high infection rate in the subsequent visit. There was no statistical association between new seropositive cases and seasons (P>0.05). Furthermore, positive to negative seroconversion was observed. Of the 94 females that were expected to parturate, 15% aborted with 29% of these being seropositive. Retained placenta was observed in 4.3% of the domestic ruminants. Of the 79 calves that were screened, 21.5% were seropositive with majority born from seropositive dams. Calves born from seropositive dams were 27 times more likely to be seropositive. Growth rate was not different (p>0.05) between calves suckling from seropositive and seronegative dams.",

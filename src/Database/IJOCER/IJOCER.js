      "In this time, one of the most and fastest forms of communication is electronic mail or what we call e-mail. However, the increase of e-mail users has resulted in the dramatic increase of spam emails in the past few years. Spam is the use of electronic messaging systems to send bulk data. In this paper, e-mail data were classified as ham email and spam email using supervised learning algorithms. Three different classifiers such as Naïve Bayesian (NB) classifier, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier were used. The experiment was performed by applying filtering on the classifiers. The result shows the difference between the classifier before and after applying filtering algorithm. To examine the performance of the selected classification methods or algorithms, namely Naïve Bayes, SVM and KNN, true positive, false positive, precision, recall and F-measure were validated. There was a time difference using those classification algorithms. KNN and SMO algorithms are almost the best classifiers among the three before applying filtering algorithm. Sequential minimal optimization (SMO) is an algorithm used to solve quadratic programming (QP) problem that arises during the training of support vector machines (SVM) and after applying filtering algorithm. SMO algorithm is the best classifier algorithm.  For this experiment, the data mining tool called WEKA was used.",

      "Information System (IS) is used for information communication. But the problem with the existing Agro-ISs is that they are not integrated. To integrate it, we need to have an integration framework. Generally, much has been done on the designing framework for IS integration. However, there are credible things which can be added to improve these frameworks. A framework can be designed in such a way that it guides users on technologies to be used, skills needed for the task, goals, outcome and output of integration. This is what this study focused to contribute. To design the framework, guiding factors were established. These factors were the one which surround farmers and in one way or another hinder or support accessibility of information from integrated ISs. The factors were discussed and presented in the mapping matrix. Under each factor, viability of technology on the ground was established and compared against the available technology. From the mapping matrix, scenarios on possible applications were established. Guides on Technologies, skills, goals, output and outcome of integration were established to form a framework for integrating applications and ISs. Then the framework was demonstrated empirically and compared with the existing frameworks. Results show that the proposed framework is more comprehensive in terms of guides it provides, than the existing frameworks.",

      "Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or microsatellites constitute a countable portion of genomes. However, the significance of SSRs in organelle genomes has not been completely understood. The availability of organelle genome sequences allows us to understand the organization of SSRs in their genic and intergenic regions. In the current study, the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of different taxa of plants were surveyed. The present study only focused on different authors’ investigations and conclusions made based on their results in relation to the different plants. This study helps the researchers to know the different structures of plant genomes, improves the understanding of existing genomes and helps to find newer genomes.    ",

      "When a data warehouse (DW) is built, typical extraction, transformation, and loading operations are made, including cleaning tasks of the data, conflicts resolution, inconsistencies identification, and constrains checking, among others. In this work, two databases (DB) were combined to obtain indexes approved and failing course in basic sciences area (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry) of the Institute of Technology of San Luis Potosí (ITSLP for their initials in Spanish). The database table intermediate of the transactional database was used to calculate dimensions and fact database tables of one warehouse. Stored data in DW are the input to Data Mining Algorithms and validation information process. This benefit was not expected. At last, the combined database was divided into a transactional database and historical database, to avoid redundancy, inconsistency, incongruity, and other integrity issues and to prepare the historical database to update DW. This DW will be suitable to carry out statistical queries in diverse areas and faculties. The final divisions of mixed database and alternative uses of intermediate tables are some non-awaiting results of original planning of project.",

      "It is very important to improve the design of the real-time operating system (RTOS) especially if we want to use it in some special devices. Numerous researches have accepted conventional RTOS as being the customary approach for designing devices used by children. This is because these are able to facilitate the implementation different criteria such as clustering, stability and alternate programs. In this paper, numerous publications have been analyzed to observe the performance of the RTOS when it is subjected to varied constraints. The study focuses on a review of RTOS in relation to play models to analyze their capabilities on various computing platforms and OSs. The publications which we have collected have been sorted out to comprehensively review thereby leading to the configuration of several factors affecting the features within the system. Likewise, statistics and results have facilitated adoption of a more focused approach towards the development of RTOS. While this program ranks clustering and performance as being the highest RTOS criteria for all applications, alternate programs considered this to be the least important. Thus, criteria choice becomes an important issue to address.",

      "Gelatinous zooplankton (GZ) populations are sensitive to climate change such as environmental perturbations, and spatial changes in their abundance and biomass may be associated with degraded environmental and biota conditions. Big data time series of GZ abundances and biomass were used to analyze the annual population dynamics of gelatinous zooplankton as well as mesozooplankton in the southern Caspian Sea, Iran from 1996, 2001-2006, 2008-2013 to 2018-2019. The ctenophore, Mnemiopsis leidyi population control by environmental factors was primarily a result of decreasing the concentration of zooplankton resulted to lower reproduction as well as temperature which was highest in August-September and lowest in winter time. On the other hand, the maximum catch of Kilka on the whole coast of Iran was equivalent to 95,000 tons in the year of 1996, and after that it was severely reduced to 15,000 tons in the year 2003 and afterward.",

      "Contamination of the river by oil spill had put the health of the people who consume fish at risk. Five fish samples each of Liza falicipinis (Mullet), Sarotherodon melanotheron (Tilapia) and Sardinella maderensis (Sardine) (n=15) were collected monthly from the Bonny Estuary from February to July 2018. The samples were oven dried at 100°C and analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Model pm ver 2.02 Avanta) to determine the concentration of Zinc (Zn), Lead (Pb), Copper (Cu), Cadmium (Cd), Nickel (Ni), Chromium (Cr), Vanadium (V) and Mercury (Hg). The result show that there is significant difference (F7, 130 = 65.6, P < 0.0001) in heavy metal concentration in the three fish species. Zinc had the highest concentration followed by Lead, Copper, Nickel and Cadmium. There was no seasonal difference (F1, 136 = 1.58, P > 0.05), although dry season had higher concentration.  Sardine had the highest concentration of heavy metal followed by tilapia and mullet. Result of EDI indicates higher intake during the dry season (that is February). Highest EDI was recorded in tilapia (5673.1 ± 5632.5 mg/kg). Similarly, highest Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni and Zn were recorded in sardine whereas Pb was highest in tilapia.  Mullet had highest daily intake for February and March. Sardine had the highest THQ for Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni and Zn, whereas tilapia had high values in Cd and Ni while mullet had high values in Pb.  The implication of this result is that dry season is not the best time to consume these three fish species.",

      "Time series analyses spanning 30 years (1988 - 2017) on spatial and temporal variations in sea surface temperatures reveal the occurrence of marine heatwaves (MHWs) within the Nigerian segment of the Gulf of Guinea. For specific focus, three locations were also chosen along Nigeria’s coastal zone, namely Lagos lagoon (western region), the Niger Delta (Forcados/Central region) and outer Cross River estuary (eastern region). Daily SST data was subjected to MHW detection algorithm, and then examined using Gaussian and Poisson distribution models to delineate the distribution of maximum intensities and frequency of occurrence of these extreme events, respectively. Determining the likelihood difference of maximum intensities of MHWs and the association between MHW count and occurrence year during the period was done using Kruskal-Wallis and Kendall rank correlation tests, respectively. Results show that the entire study area has been experiencing MHWs more frequently in recent decades, with the northwest region having higher counts. Strong seasonality exists, as more MHWs occurred in winter months (October to May). Peak month for MHW occurrence over the entire study area was May. November is shared as a peak month for the three focus coastal locations, although MHWs in Cross River and Niger Delta locations exhibited multi-modal patterns. None of the MHWs in Lagos location was categorized as severe. This study contributes to the World Climate Research Programme Grand Challenge on Weather and Climate Extremes.",

      "Since 2011, the coasts of North America, Mexico, and the Caribbean have experienced an unusual increase in the arrival of Sargassum. A large amount of Sargassum has caused significant economic losses in the tourism sector of the Dominican Republic as well as the entire Caribbean region.  The present article discusses the possible factors contributing toward this unusual increase. Large Sargassum masses are generated in the Sargasso Sea. In this region, several current systems converge with the North Atlantic Subtropical Anticyclone (NASH), which has an area of displacement extending from Brazil to Africa. Sargassum is transported toward Africa, where it meets the Northern Equatorial Recirculation Region (NERR) before recirculating back toward the Caribbean in a clockwise pattern (Putman et al., 2018; Wang, 2007). Upon returning to the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, Sargasso grows flowers and distributes across the region. The effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is also analyzed as well as the possible influence of Sahara dust, which acts as a source of nutrients for the growth and development of Sargassum. In the Dominican Republic, the species found in the current study included Sargassum fluitans and Sargassum natans. As for the species Sargassum polyceratium var. ovatum, the variety ovatum has not been reported before on the coasts of the Dominican Republic.",

    abstract:
      "In attempt to study the spatial differences in autumnal equatorial upwelling intensity relative to bio-productivity in the eastern equatorial Atlantic, oceanographic in situ data along regions 10°W, 0°E, 2.5°E and 6°E, collected in the Gulf of Guinea during autumn cruise carried out in September 2007 were analyzed. The surface mean values for temperature along 10°W, 0°E, 2.5°E and 6°E are 25.02, 26.15, 26.88 and 25.60°C, respectively. There was eastward weakening of the equatorial undercurrent from 10°W until its complete disappearance at 6°E. The highest concentration of nitrate recorded at the surface at 10°W was attributed to the shoaling pycnocline observed at this region. The surface mean values for nitrate along 10°W, 0°E, 2.5°E and 6°E are 0.37, 0.09, 0.04 and 0.04 μmol.kg-1, respectively. In response to the shoaling pycnocline at 10°W, corresponding to the highest concentration of chlorophyll fluorescence was recorded at this region. The surface mean values for chlorophyll fluorescence along 10°W, 0°E, 2.5°E and 6°E are 0.34, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.08 mg/m3, respectively. Contributions to equatorial upwelling by the equatorial undercurrent were the strongest and mostly expressed along 10°W. Profiles for apparent oxygen utilization and chlorophyll fluorescence gave indications that biological response to surface enrichments within the equatorial bands was highest at region 10°W. Vertical sections for studied parameters were unsuggestive of westward advection from 6°E to 10°W within the equatorial band, and this signifies the important role of vertical processes in equatorial enrichment at 10°W during boreal autumn.",

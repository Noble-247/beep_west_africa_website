    abstract:
      "Historically Artemisia herba alba (AHA) is widely used in traditional Moroccan medicine. Few studies have been carried out to confirm its traditional use, in particularly immunological studies and to the authors’ knowledge; no study has treated the in vivo immunomodulatory effect of AHA aqueous extracts. This work was established to assess the immunological effects of AHA, including the humoral and cellular immunity effects in vivo. The immunomodulatory effect was assessed by measuring the titer of specific antibodies by the agglutination technique after immunization of Wistar rats with sheep red blood cells, while the pro-inflammatory effect was performed using a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model. Administered AHA’s aqueous extract (AE) appears to have significantly (p < 0.01) stimulated the production of anti-SRBC antibodies with a dose-dependent effect compared to the control. These results were confirmed by a significant increase in the levels of white blood cells in particular neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils (p<0.05) for the doses 0.5 and 1 g/ml/bw. For the same doses of the extract, a proinflammatory effect was observed by the size of edema and the presence of very dense inflammatory infiltrate made up of lymphocytes, plasma cells and polymorphonuclear neutrophils. The AHA’s AE have shown an important immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory activities in vivo by enhancing the production of antibodies and the inflammatory reaction.",

      "Angylocalyx oligophyllus (Fabaceae) is a shrub used traditionally to treat diabetes mellitus and intestinal parasites. Although it is also used by pregnant women, no scientific study has yet revealed its effects on pregnancy. This work aimed to assess the toxic effects of A. oligophyllus leaves aqueous extract on pregnancy, reproduction and fetal development in pregnant rats. The acute toxicity of the A. oligophyllus leaves aqueous extract was firstly performed in female non-pregnant rats. Then, pregnant rats were divided into a control and three test groups receiving, respectively distilled water and A. oligophyllus leaves aqueous extract doses (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) by gavage for 20 days (from pregnancy screening day). The daily body masses of pregnant rats and the 21st-day relative organs masses were measured for assessing the pregnancy progress. The numbers of corpora lutea, implantation sites, live and dead fetuses and calculated pre-and-post implantation loss for appreciating the reproduction, and the fetuses’ masses for fetal development assessment, were recorded on the 21st day. Acute administration of the A. oligophyllus leaves aqueous extract (2000 mg/kg) did not cause any death or adverse effect in non-pregnant female rats. The LD50 was estimated higher than 2000 mg/kg. Pregnancy and reproductive parameters did not vary significantly between plant extract-treated rats and control. However, although fetal development parameters did not change significantly between the groups, the percentages of small (SGA) and large (LGA) pups for the gestational age were higher in rats treated with the dose extract of 200 mg/kg, compared to control (20 and 11%, respectively). Current data showed that the A. oligophyllus leaves aqueous extract does not impair motherhood and reproduction. Nevertheless, limitation of the dose is recommended during treatment in pregnant women to avoid adverse effect on fetal development.",

    abstract:
      "Dietary supplements, particularly nutraceuticals, are an expanding sector on the South African market, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, regulatory authorities do not regulate nutraceuticals and concern arose regarding safety, quality and efficacy of the product reaching the end-user. The aim of the study was to evaluate the pharmaceutical quality, specifically the physical and the in-vitro release properties of two commonly marketed L-lysine products in South Africa. An experimental design was used. Two L-lysine products, a tablet and a capsule, available on the South African market were evaluated for pharmaceutical quality. Tests performed were: Weight variation test, dimensions test, friability test, hardness test, assay, and drug release studies. The quality of products was compared to official USP standards. Tablets were of consistent diameter, length and thickness. Not more than 2 tablets had weights outside the 5% deviation range for each sample. Tablets had an average friability of 17.56%, although their hardness was greater than the acceptable range. All tablets disintegrated within the 15 min. Two out of three samples had amount of lysine below the acceptable range. Tablets sampled released just about 70% of the contained L-lysine by 45 min. Capsules had inconsistent powder weight and contained an amount of L-lysine less than the label claim. Capsules disintegrated within 4 min and released just over 75% of drug by 45 min. There seems to be inconsistences in the characteristics of L-lysine products and their quality cannot be guaranteed. More investigations on other marketed L-lysine products are suggested, to further advice on the necessity of a relook of their quality assurance procedures and labelling.",

      "This research is aimed at producing alternative starch used for tablet binding from amura tuber. The microbiological load and physicochemical properties of native and modified amura starches were determined using plate counting method and standard method of BP. Amylose and amylopectin content of native and modified amura starches were determined using spectrophotometric method. Binding and disintegrant abilities of these starches were studied using paracetamol as a model drug. Paracetamol tablets were formulated by wet granulation method using NAS, AS, and EHS as binders. The tablet characteristics were evaluated using standard method of BP. The results of this study indicates that microbial and Fungi load of NAS, AS, EHS and MS range from 1 to 30 colonies forming unit (cfc/g). The swelling power and solubility of the starches were found to increase with temperature and the values are higher for EHS and AS. Also the NAS have crushing strength of (4.766 ± 0.152), AS (7.000 ± 0.500), EHS (3.900 ± 0.100) and MS (5.633±1.184) and are significant different at (p<0.05) while friability of NAS is (0.760 ± 0.068, AS (1.060 ± 0.121, EHS (0.556 ± 0040) and MS (0.873 ± 0.1007) and they are significant different at (p<0.05). The results of disintegration of the tablets indicate that EHS disintegrate faster than NAS, AS and MS. The results of dissolution of paracetamol tablets formulated with NAS, AS, EHS and MS at t50, t70 and t90 minutes are within range of 70%-97%. (quantity dissolved in 45 min ≥ 70% BP standard).",

      "The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge base of traditional medicine practitioners (TMPs) in Benue State in relation to current good manufacturing practice for effective quality, safety, and increased economic value. A cross-sectional study was conducted among the TMPs using questionnaire. Information such as practice area, type of herbal medicine preparations, water quality, preservatives as well as knowledge of packaging of finished herbal medicines was evaluated. Over 55% of the TMPs practice herbal medicine alone, while others combine other traditional medicine disciplines alongside herbal medicine. Majority of the TMPs produce extemporaneous products for their patient while 10% produce products for sale. A number corresponding to 18% of the TMPs use either tap or borehole water, the others use water from well, streams and rivers. The herbal medicines produced by the TMPs are largely liquids and only 47% have any knowledge of preservatives and fewer have any knowledge on packaging of herbal medicines. This study shows that the majority of the TMPs lack appropriate technical resources and knowledge for herbal medicine production. Hence, there is an urgent need for a coordinated intervention in terms of working tools and trainings.",

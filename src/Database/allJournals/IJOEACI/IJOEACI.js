      "Technology transition is an essential activity of engineering that bridges the gap between theory and reality. Computer engineering, for instance, takes the infinite accuracy of pure mathematics and applies it to practical situations. For precision irrigation and the calculation of ETc (estimated crop water use), we have the physics and mathematics expressed in the UN’s excellent documentation. A previous paper by the author expressed those mathematics in open-source software. The results were tested against the UN’s documentation and applied to Teff, a crop grown in Ethiopia. Since weather data had to be constructed from what was available, this present paper focuses on sweet corn grown in the USA, while using unmodified weather data downloaded from a regional weather station. It also goes into detail on determining various parameters required for calculation. An additional stop was to use next-day rain prediction in an effort to further minimize water use. Next-day rain prediction resulted in a 20% decline in water use while the crop would never go more than 24 h without an appropriate amount of water being applied. The result also demonstrates the integration of software components with a small cigarette-pack sized computer suitable for embedding within irrigation systems. Finally, ETc is translated into a volume of irrigation to be applied on a daily basis, taking into account moisture already available, ETc, and rain falling during the previous 24 h. Growing-season volume appears large at first glance but correlates with other consumption studies.",

      "Egypt is one of the countries mostly faced with the problem of China’s fake spare parts used in replacing original components. The spare parts components trade is close to 2.7 billion LE out of 9.3 billion LE, that is, the volume of imported spare parts in Egypt, as announced by the official speaker of the Ministry of Trade and Industry in Egypt. Hence, it can be seen that China’s components adulteration problem is threatening nationally and internationally; and it is easier due to the great expansion of supply chains. Therefore, this paper aims to deliver the original parts to customers via three-bin-system (Kanban) by using e-kanban in creating e-pedigree kanban. Many aspects are discussed to control the transportation system with minimum costs. These include e-Pedigree, Databases, RFID, 2D barcodes, multi-agent systems, and the integration of these tools to develop a system to secure the importing spare parts via VSM (Value Stream Map). This paper proposed E-PKS (Electronic Pedigree Kanban System) for track and traces any products' logistic via using tracking procedures supported by image code technique. The E-PKS are joints of VSM and consist of two phases: the first control the VSM in different agents and the second phase focuses on the development of the 2D BC of the product to guarantee right channel to customers by using the proposed image code technique.",

      "Routing in MANET is a critical task due to highly dynamic environment. A routing protocol is needed whenever a packet needs to be transmitted to destination via number of nodes and numerous routing protocols have been proposed for ad-hoc network. In this paper we try to judge the impact of both reactive as well proactive type protocols by increasing the density of nodes in the network, keeping source node fixed and move the destination node and lastly, keeping the destination node fixed and move source node. In all the three cases, the performance of the routing protocol have been analyzed to improve and select efficient routing protocol for network setup and its designing for practical scenario. The performance matrix includes delivery fraction, packet loss and end to end delay.",

      "Spatial joins are used to combine the spatial objects. The efficient processing depends upon the spatial queries. The execution time and input/output (I/O) time of spatial queries are crucial, because the spatial objects are very large and have several relations. In this article, we use several techniques to improve the efficiency of the spatial join; 1. We use R*-trees for spatial queries since R*-trees are very suitable for supporting spatial queries as it is one of the efficient member of R-tree family; 2. The different shapes namely point, line, polygon and rectangle are used for isolating and clustering the spatial objects; 3. We use scales with the shapes for spatial distribution. We also present several techniques forimproving its execution time with respect to the central processing unit (CPU) and I/O-time. In the proposed constraints based spatial join algorithm, total execution time is improved compared with the existing approach in order of magnitude. Using a buffer of reasonable size, the I/O time is optimal. The performance of the various approaches is investigated with the synthesized and real data set and the experimental results are compared with the large data sets from real applications.",

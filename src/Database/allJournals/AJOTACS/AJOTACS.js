    abstract:
      "Although it is generally accepted that modified ultrafiltration (MUF) improves operative outcomes in pediatric cardiac surgery, the evidence for this remains equivocal. Previous meta-analyses have been affected by significant patient and method heterogeneity. Google Scholar and PUBMED were searched between January 1st 1966 and May 31st 2022. We conducted a meta-analysis after pragmatically minimising patient and method heterogeneity. There were 631 patients (314 MUF vs 317 ‘No MUF’) in the the mortality analysis and 258 patients (129 MUF vs 129 ‘No MUF’) in the ‘duration-of-ventilation’ (DOV) and ‘length-of-hospital stay’ (LOHS) analyses. There was no significant difference in operative mortality, DOV and LOHS. There is no evidence that MUF improves these operative outcomes in paediatric cardiac surgery.",

    abstract:
      "The arterial switch operation (ASO) is considered the gold standard for repair of D-transposition of the great arteries. However, when patients present after the third week of life, the early operative outcomes may be less predictable. Current guidelines recommend extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) availability when the arterial switch is performed on patients between 3 to 6 weeks of age. Controversy remains regarding the safe upper age limit for a successful arterial switch operation. An objective assessment of the efficacy of a treatment requires a comparison of the treatment outcome with the natural history. We reviewed the literature and used the most externally valid data to create a composite survival curve that facilitates the comparison of surgical outcome and natural history. The data suggest that, where ECMO is available, the ASO is the best option for patients at any age up to 14 weeks old. The ASO is also the best option for patients up to 2 weeks of age where ECMO is not available. The atrial switch operation (AtSO) is the best option for patients between 2 weeks and 14 weeks of age where ECMO is not available. The ASO or the AtSO should be offered as soon as possible after birth; surgery after 14 weeks of age may not improve 10 year survival compared to the natural history",

      "This study aim to report our experience in the fabrication of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) by describing the operative technique and the immediate surgical results. The study carried out retrospective study of the records of 1467 patients who underwent AVF creation during the period from January 2008 to December 2020.  1396 patients (95.2%) had already been dialyzed with a central venous catheter for one month (1 and 6 months). The procedures were performed under local anesthesia. Distal radio-cephalic AVFs were performed in 92.2% of cases. The fabrication of a radio cephalic arteriovenous fistula was described. The arteriovenous fistulas were patented in 100% at the end of the procedure. We observed 3.1% complications in the immediate postoperative period. Morbidity was constituted by early thrombosis which represented 58.8% of complications followed by false aneurysms (27.5%), compressive hematomas (11.8%) and hemorrhages (1.9%). Fistulas complicated by thrombosis were reconnected. Treatment of the false aneurysm consisted of evacuation of the false aneurysm, surgical hemostasis, and removal of the AVF. The native arteriovenous fistula is the best access route for chronic hemodialysis. This procedure carries little risk. However, complications can be fatal, hence the interest of an early and adapted management of these complications. ",

      "Contemporary surgical practice relating to Tetralogy of Fallot is shifting towards earlier correction; however, a recent large study proposes later correction to increase event free survival. Surgery aims to improve the quantity and quality of life at minimal risk to the patient. Surgical outcome and risk assessment requires a comparison of externally valid studies of natural history and surgical outcome. The authors reviewed the literature to identify the most externally valid natural history and surgical outcome data and used it to develop a composite survival graph to help clinicians determine when surgery would offer the greatest survival advantage. The composite graph suggests that, for symptomatic patients, the greatest survival advantage occurs when corrective surgery is performed within the 1st week of life.",

      "Anaesthetic modalities for arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation include general (GA), local (LA) and regional anaesthesia (RA). Ultrasound guided regional anaesthesia (USRA) proved to have more benefits in AVF creation than the other two. This study conducted at the Douala General Hospital aimed to assess these benefits over GA and RA. A retrospective review was performed on 217 records of patients who underwent an AVF creation between January 2015 and December 2018. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients were recorded. Analysis of variance, Pearson’s chi-square test and binomial logistic regression were performed and a p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Of the 217 records reviewed, age ranged between 51 and 60 years old, and 71.9% were males. The distribution of AVF according to the anaesthetic type was: 83 (38.2%) for GA, and 68 (31.3%) for USRA. The rate of changeover was significantly associated with the anaesthetic type [GA: null vs. USRA: 8 (11.8%), p < 0.001]. The total anaesthesia administration time and surgical time were significantly associated with the anaesthetic type. The association between the anaesthetic type and the complication was of no statistical importance. This study thus showed that USRA was superior to either GA in AVF creation. The surgical duration mitigated the time required for its performance as compared to GA. It was the most stable in term of cost of anaesthesia and yielded higher rates of functional patency 3 months after the fistulae were created.",

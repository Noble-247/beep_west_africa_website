      "Complications associated to dental extraction remain a concern and can be a source of morbidity. However, adequate management could avoid these complications. The purpose of this study was to assess the risks factors and complications associated with dental extraction in the Western Region of Cameroon. This was a cross sectional study carried out between January 25 to April 30, 2019. Patients 15 years and above were recruited by convenience sampling. Included in the study were   patients who had tooth extraction and managed for post-extraction complications. . A total of 1500 patients were consulted and 170 patients presented with post-extraction complications giving a frequency of 11.34 %.The main reasons for consultation was toothache 146(85.88 %), (54%) of the patients who presented with complications were males. Dental extractions were performed by dental therapists 91(53.53%), dental students on training 49(28.82%) and dental surgeons 30(17.65%).Post-extraction complications were hemorrhages 54(27%), suppurative alveolitis 53(26.23%), dry socket 23(11.56%), post-extraction pain 20(10%) and postoperative edema 20(10%). Multivariate analysis revealed that the factors associated with the hemorrhage were the maxillary arch extraction (OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.6-8.5, p= 0.04), extraction performed by dental students on training (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.1-4.37, p= 0.028) and tobacco use (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.01- 3.99, p= 0.012). Dry socket was associated to mandibular extraction (OR 4.22, 95% CI 2.19- 8.1, p= 0.000) and those associated with inflammation were female (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.11-4.18, p= 0.017) and extraction of 4 teeth (OR 6.17, 95% CI 1.15-32.93, p= 0.029). Dental extractions were performed mainly by dental therapists and complications after tooth extraction were significantly associated with extractions performed by dental students on training.",

      "The present study was conducted to give an insight into the level of perception, practice and attitude of Sudanese dentists in relation to infection control measures at the time of the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 through an online survey. A sample of 315 participants was enrolled in the study. An online survey was conducted in August 2020, using the Google Form software. Data were analyzed using the statistical software for social science (SPSS). Mean scores of perceptions, practice attitude sections, were compared to some of the questions in general characteristics section using the Kruskal–Wallis and the Mann–Whitney U tests to derive a relationship. The most prevalent age group (49.4 %) was between the ages of 25-34. The female and male percentages were 70.2% and 29.8% respectively. A statistically significant difference was found when perception was compared based on years of practicing with the highest mean score (144.44) among those who were practicing more that 10 years (p=0.002). No significant difference was found in the mean score of perception among participants who received or did not received training in infection control (p=0.77). However, significant relationships were noted between the variables (dental professions, years of practicing and receiving lecture on infection control) and practice with p value of (0,0,0.001 respectively).  Sudanese dentists showed adequate perception and attitude towards COVID-19 infection controls and measures in dental clinics. However, there was limited understanding by dentists of the extra precautionary measures to protect patients from COVID-19.",

      "The use Dental radiographs has become an integral part of modern clinical dentistry to investigate complaints of patients. This study aimed at determining the level of awareness of dental radiological examination among patients attending dental treatment at the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) dental clinic in Dar es salaam, Tanzania. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, which included patients who underwent radiological examination. A specially designed questionnaire was used to gather information on the demographics and level of awareness of the patients regarding X-ray examination. The data obtained was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science-V23. The association between variables was assessed by the Chi-square test, and p-value was set at p<0.05. A total of 322 participants were included in the study of which 184 (57.1%) were females. The age range of the participants was 18 to 89 years (mean of 37.2 ± 15.2 years). There was a statistically significant association between self-perceived awareness about dental radiographs and level of education, age and previous experience of the participants. Only 39.4% reported to have had some information regarding dental X-rays and among them, in 89%, the source was dental personnel. Only 36% said there was no problem in exposing a pregnant woman to dental X-rays. 92.7% said there is a need of using special protective gear when exposing a pregnant woman to dental X-ray. Generally, there was a low awareness of dental X-ray examination in this group of patients.",

      "The aim of this work is to report the clinical presentation and management of pregnancy epulis (PE) among pregnant women that attended ante-natal clinic in Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, Kaduna, Northern, Nigeria. Three hundred and twenty self-administered, structured questionnaires were administered to pregnant women that attended ante-natal clinic in Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, Kaduna. Intraoral examination was done for all that filled the questionnaire. The study was done from January 2018 to July 2018. Eight cases (2.5%) of pregnancy epulis were diagnosed among 320 pregnant women. The age of the women ranged between 23 to 34 years with mean age ±28.5 years (SD=3.9); four (50%) were in their third trimester, three (37%) in their second trimester and one (12.5%) was in her first trimester of pregnancy. Five (62.5%) occurred in the anterior gingiva of the maxillary teeth, and two (25%) mandibular anterior gingivae and one (12.5%) at the mandibular posterior gingivae. The prevalence of PE from this study was one pregnant woman among forty, ratios 1:40. Our treatment modalities included: Oral hygiene prophylaxis and surgical excision of the tumour under local anaesthesia. There is need to pay attention to plaque control in pregnant women to reduce the incidence and prevent complications that may arise from the tumour such as life threatening haemorrhage. All pregnant women should have routine oral hygiene prophylaxis to reduce incidence of pregnancy epulis.",

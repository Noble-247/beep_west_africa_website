      "The model known as SERVICEQUAL (SQ) examines the correlation between service satisfaction and the gaps that occur between customers’ expectations prior to service and perceptions after being served. The gaps are tested over five dimensions: tangibles of the service, assurance, empathy, reliability, and responsiveness of the service provider. This paper aims to examine the satisfaction of women with childbirth care by exploring correlations between the gaps in the five SQ dimensions and testing the influence of each dimension on the others. Closed-ended questionnaires were used to evaluate satisfaction from SQ dimensions using 1-5 on Likert scale. This study adds to existing literature by offering an insight into the way mothers assess their birthing services by looking at their pre-procedure expectations compared to how they perceive performance post-delivery. The correlations between the gaps in the service’s dimensions were higher after birth than before birth. Significant correlations between the gaps themselves were seen in all five dimensions. The findings suggest that a successful child delivery reduces the mother's anxiety, such that if prior to birth, the five service dimensions exhibit no correlation, then after birth when the mother is less anxious, and her cognitive dissonance is reduced. Stronger correlations form between all five service dimensions. The significant correlations between all five dimensions suggest that receiving empathic treatment from the service provider causes the mother to be pleased with the tangibles, responsiveness, reliability, assurance of the medical staff.",

      "Care quality is a major concern for healthcare settings. Because of its essential place in hospital management, Nurse Manager (NM) is a critical link in the care system. This study aimed to analyse the role and leadership of the NM in the care quality improvement at the Charles de Gaulle Pediatric Teaching Hospital (CHUP-CDG). This was a qualitative and descriptive study. Ten NMs from clinical services selected on a reasoned sampling basis participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Non-participant observations and a documentary review were carried out. Data collection was conducted from August 1st to 31st, 2017 at the CHUP-CDG. A thematic analysis based on the professional practice framework (PPF) of Oldland et al. performed. The NM’s role and leadership nurse covered three of the seven healthcare quality domains of the PPF, namely: (1) Promotion of safety; (2) Positive interpersonal behaviours; (3) Clinical leadership and governance. Four healthcare quality domains are not covered: Management of the environment, evidence-based practice, medical/technical competence, and person-centred care. The NMs of clinical services hold a special place at the CHUP-CDG. Consequently, the success of quality care improvement depends on their involvement and commitment in all the domains of healthcare quality.",

      "While several studies have investigated how stress-related situations affect cortisol levels, few studies have examined the relationship between cortisol levels and psychological measures related to postpartum psychological status. This study investigated the relationship between salivary cortisol and postpartum psychological status and bonding attachment. This study is a cross-sectional study. Participants were recruited at the 1-month postpartum checkup and included 70 consenting mothers at 1 month postpartum. Salivary cortisol levels, profile of mood states (POMS), general health questionnaire (GHQ), maternal anxiety screening scale (MASS), and mother-infant bonding scale (MIBS) were measured for association. Salivary cortisol levels were significantly associated with scores on the GHQ; depression dimension of POMS; childbirth satisfaction, child-rearing ease, confidant, and lack of confidence subscales of MASS; and MIBS (r=.369 P=.002). There were particularly strong associations with GHQ (r=.427 P=.000), childbirth satisfaction subscale of MASS (r=-.412 P=.000), and MIBS (r=.369 P=.002) scores. The measurement of maternal salivary cortisol at one month postpartum could be a method to screen mothers for postpartum depression. However, it should be taken into account that salivary cortisol levels may reflect factors other than psychological state, and further investigation of related factors is necessary",

      "This study aimed to clarify the effects of long-term hospitalization of a psychiatric in-patient on her specific psychiatric symptoms and behaviors to provide suggestions regarding nursing support for in- patients. Unstructured interviews were conducted over several months with a long-term female patient (Ms. A) hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital between August 2017 and 2018. Analysis was performed using descriptive and interpretive phenomenological methodology. Four themes emerged from the patient’s interviews: (1) Reduced interactions with others and becoming autistic due to a restless life when she was first admitted to the hospital; (2) Persistent psychological resistance due to fear of treatment through medications; (3) Delusion due to missing her family; and (4) Delusion due to longing for a stable, normal life. Our interpretations of the results for the phenomenological study on Ms. A's long-term hospitalized experience indicated that she has been living her life, reconstructing her life story by incorporating her pre-hospitalization life with her family and her longings for a normal life into her current life through delusion. We recommend that nurses should pay more attention to mental symptoms and behaviors, such as delusions, and understand the experiences behind delusions.",

      "Continuing professional development program has become a vital tool to update the knowledge, skills and competence of health professionals worldwide. Nursing in Nigeria under the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN) joined the clique and commenced Mandatory Continuing Professional Development Programme (MCPDP) about a decade ago. This study was set to elicit the perception of clinical nurses in Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife towards MCPDP. A questionnaire based cross-sectional survey was undertaken among two hundred and seventy-one (271) nurses. The findings of the study revealed that 54.7% had poor perception towards MCPDP. There was a significant relationship between gender (p= 0.040), age, (p= 0.000), current educational qualification (p =0.000), cadre (p =0.000), work experience (p= 0.000), area of practice (p= 0.000) and perception towards MCPDP. However, in the light of these findings it was recommended that the stakeholders in Nigerian Nursing should embrace a more accommodating environment for the delivery of the program and also review the contents to periodically accommodate other specialties tailored to their area of practice.",
